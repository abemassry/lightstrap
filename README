lightstrap combines gravity and twitter bootstrap

Gravity is a simple PHP framework for rapid webapp development
The changes made to gravity here will be merged back into the gravity framework
the goal is to provide a consistent front end experience for webapps while maintaining compatibility with Gravity.  Since the views are an integral part of a webapp framework twitter bootstrap was chosen to be used here.

A demo will be updated at http://lightstrap.massindustries.org
